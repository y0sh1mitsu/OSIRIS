# NFQUEUE
Project created following a request from my Advanced System Security teacher at the École Supérieure de Génie Informatique.

The script is written in Python 3, it uses the libraries :
- Scapy : For package manipulation.
- Netfilterqueue : For filtering packets using the Netfilter Firewall and the Queue option in order to put them on hold for the time of a decision..

</p>

Currently a manual action from a user is needed to filter the packages one by one.
Whitelist / blacklist are set up in order to not have requests for action to a user on already processed packets.

TO DO :
- Implement an API focused on Cyber Threat Intelligence in order to perform automatic filtering based on an IOC existing or not on the remote IP address (IP of a C&C, IP used in a malicious campaign et cetera).
- Implementation of threads to process packets on several queues.
- Implementation of a GUI (Graphical User Interface).
